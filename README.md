This project analyses COVID-19 vaccination data from the UK (2021â€“2022) to uncover trends, regional disparities, and vaccination behaviour patterns. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and NumPy, the project performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and linear regression modelling.
